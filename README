Comparison of taxonomic trees induced by group of samples.

**** Algorithm to get the most different pairs of (groups of) patients:

- Choose a metadatum such as its values can induce a partition of the set of samples
(Or only select groups of samples by their names)

- Construct the complete graph of these trees where edges are weighted by a certain comparison function (Zhang-Shasha's algorithm, total ratio of nodes, ...)

- Apply Kruskal's algorithm on this graph to obtain the minimal covering tree

- Store distances in a matrix and select the pairs of groups de patients that are the most different (which distance is superior to the third quartile of the distances)
(Default distance is LCA-path-length difference)
